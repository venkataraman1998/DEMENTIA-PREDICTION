Dementia, an incurable disease characterized by cognitive decline, is on the rise worldwide.
More than ever, it is crucial to predict dementia cases and introduce patients to the proper care as
soon as possible. One method to achieve this goal is to utilize machine learning models designed
for natural language processing to analyze speech patterns, searching for early flags of the
disease. This project examines the efficacy of six models, DAN, BERT, RoBERTa, longformer,
clinical long former, and BigBIRD, to determine which models best predict dementia cases.
Transcribed conversations with patients exhibiting signs of dementia and those without any signs
provide inputs to each model. Precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy will evaluate each
model's performance.
